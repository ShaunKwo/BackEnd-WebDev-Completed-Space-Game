How to play my Space Exploration Game!

1. Register if you havent created an account 
    or login if u have (REGISTER and LOGIN button in Nav bar)

2. The REGISTER and LOGIN button will change to Logout->to exit 
     and Profile button is to view tasks and quests you have completed, abilities and items you own

3. TASKS in the Nav bar goes to a task page where you can see all the tasks you can complete
     and click on the button to complete the task that you want.
     
4. Complete Tasks to gain points and view your total points in USERS in the nav Bar, 
    where you can also the progress of other users using the PROGRESS BAR (special feature) 
    which forms a bit of a competition

5. It's like a battle pass system where you can claim rewards at a certain number of points 
    using buttons that will appear when you have gained 
    600 => Engineer
    800 => Scientist
    1000 => Captain
It is only with these appearances that you can process to QUESTS 

6. In QUESTS, you can view all the quests there is.
NOTE THAT YOU CAN ONLY COMPLETE EACH QUEST ONCE OR THERE WOULD BE ERROR AND WOULD NOT LOAD
AS I HAVE A MIDDLWARE TO CHECK IF QUEST HAS BEEN COMPLETED BEFORE IF YES THEN DONT ALLOW COMPLETE AGAIN

7. Planets in the Nav just show all the planets there are in the game

8. HOME in the Nav Bar is where users can message each other in the game
